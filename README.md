Behind of this project is a SQL Server 2019 Database.

# Database : 
my goal is  I use Sql Server 2019 for the purpose of Database for this Project. I have designed a BCNF database,
I try to design and develop my projects with Fat-Server / Thin Client approach. It means I try to implement more than 90% of business logics in the Database layer with Stored-procedures to do CRUD and Reports, different types of Functions, Triggers, Check Constraint, Unique Constraints and …
This approach help me to reduce the maintenance time/cost. I have been working with this approach more than 15 years and it really make me different among developers in Iran. Speed of doing projects is another achievement of me to use this method. 
In this project database, I have about 1600 Stored-Procedures, 1100 Functions and many triggers and constraint to implementing Business Logic.
